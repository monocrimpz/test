# Zivid SDK roadmap

Welcome to the [official Zivid SDK roadmap](https://github.com/zivid/zivid/projects/1). We’re happy to see you here! This roadmap is updated on a quarterly basis or shorter. It describes the plans of our software platform for the benefit of developers to see the fruits of the efforts from our team.

We believe that transparency is an important fundament of a healthy ecosystem which we want to grow and include you in. Through this effort we also encourage you to provide us your thoughts and feedback, so please let us know what you care about by reaching out to us through customersuccess@zivid.com.
We know that we are going to get things wrong along the way, but we will try to adjust our plans based on feedback from our customers and developers, and we will also come up with new ideas as we learn that will be included into our roadmap in the future. 

The structure of our platform roadmap is organized in a way that we want to highlight.
-	Plans for our upcoming software releases are shown in their own categories, while ideas and concepts that are planned but not yet committed to a release can be found in the category “Future”.
-	We use the term “Experimental” to describe new features that have not yet reached our status of full support (our definition of “Experimental” is quite close to what some might relate to as “Beta”). Such features are typically subject to either limited testing (i.e. not yet included in our CI) or API changes - and sometimes a little bit of both. In rare occasions we might drastically change or remove an “Experimental” feature in its entirety. In this case we will exercise the same level of transparency as we always strive to and update this roadmap to let you know well in advance.

We hope that through this roadmap it will be easier for you to plan your own development execution and releases. We also look forward to hearing from you so that we can continue to provide ever better tools to make it easier for you to work with our products and make systems of the future.
